# May 23rd, start of backend
This backend is being written with frontend mostly completed.

Unfortunately, database is not done yet as MongoDB being NoSQL database discouraged me entirely.
Here I will use Python and Flask.

For the starting phase I'll use some hard coded data just to test frontend-backend communication.

# May 24th, change in language
While Flask does sound cool, I can't find any good guides for creating it and connecting it to a pre-existing frontend.
That's why I have decided to try and get a javascript backend running.
