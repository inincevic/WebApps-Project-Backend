# May 23rd, start of backend
This backend is being written with frontend mostly completed.

Unfortunately, database is not done yet as MongoDB being NoSQL database discouraged me entirely.
Here I will use Python and Flask.

For the starting phase I'll use some hard coded data just to test frontend-backend communication.
